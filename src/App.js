        For the 2020-21 season, the NFL created a COVID-19 Reserve List that was defined as any player who had tested positive, or been in close contact with someone who had tested positive for the coronavirus. While no games were cancelled by season's end, the pandemic left a profound impact across the league that resulted in postponements, high-profile players missing games, and concerns over how the virus affects long-term health.
